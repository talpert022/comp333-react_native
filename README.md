# comp333-react_native

React Native mobile app for Homework 4 completed by Cole Stevenson, Matthew Querdasi, and Tommy Alpert. The link to the website version of the app is comp333-react.web.app

## Divison Of Work

We divided the work according to the bottom tabs of the app. Matt worked on the 'Create Songs' tab which added new songs to the database. Cole did the songs list tab which displayed all the songs in the data, and allows users to edit and delete songs. Tommy worked on the tab structure of the app and the search songs tab, which allows users to search our songlist by title and artist. Cole really mastered the deployment of the backend on heroku, and we all collabed on the deployment of the frontend.
